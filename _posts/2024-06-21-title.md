It's been over a year now since I sat down and decided to write a blog post, so bear with me. To be honest, this isn't really a blog post anyway, more so just an introduction as well as a test to see if the page works. If it does, great. I'll work on fixing the layout, re-creating some kind of "susbcribe" option, and figuring out how to put images on here like the image-board I had on my previous website. I'm not sure I'm going to bother attempting a migration of all my previous posts. It is a shame that they might be lost to the sands of (internet) history, but I'm sure I'll come across in some form again. We'll see. Anyway, look forward to renewed posting!
